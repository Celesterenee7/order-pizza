#### By Celeste Renee Morton
## Description
This application is a website for a pizza company and will allow a user to choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.
* This application will use an object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* It will also use a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
## Specifications
* The user can choose toppings and a size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* The user can input these selections within a form that gathers data.
* Based off of these selections, the application will calculate a price for the user.
* Once the price is calculated, the application will show an output of the price owed for the pizza.
